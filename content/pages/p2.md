- Contagious structures for projections. In class we used Plunnecke inequality and Ruzsa inequality to prove contagious structure for projections of \\(A \times A \subset \mathbb{F}\\\_p^2\\). Are there similar results for projections of an arbitrary set \\(X \subset \mathbb{F}\\\_q^2\\)? Here is a precise question. Suppose that \\(| \pi\\\_t(X) | \le K |X|^{1/2}\\) for \\(t= 0, \infty, t\\\_1\\), and \\(t\\\_2\\). Does it follow that \\(| \pi\\\_{t\\\_1 + t\\\_2} (X)| \le K^C |X|^{1/2}\\) for a universal constant \\(C\\)? (What \\(C\\) can you get?) Similarly for \\(|\pi\\\_{t\\\_1 t\\\_2}(X)|\\) and \\(| \pi\\\_{-t}(X)|\\). See Lecture 11. (Possible reference: Katz-Tao work on "sums differences")
