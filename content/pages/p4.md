\\(|\pi_{t_1 + t_2} (X)| \le K^C |X|^{1/2}\\)

 

Contagious structures for projections. In class we used Plunnecke inequality and Ruzsa inequality to prove contagious structure for projections of \\(A \times A \subset \mathbb{F}_{p}^2\\). Are there similar results for projections of an arbitrary set \\(X \subset \mathbb{F}_{q}^2\\)?
